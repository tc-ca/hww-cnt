          <h2>Running the play</h2>
          <div class="row" style="background-color:#ececec;">
            <div class="col-md-12">
              <p>This play provides guidelines on implementing the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/impact-assessment-agency/programs/strategic-environmental-assessment/cabinet-directive-environmental-assessment-policy-plan-program-proposals.html">Cabinet Directive on the Environmental Assessment of Policy, Plan and Program Proposals</a>.</p>
              <p>The environmental assessment of policy, plan and program proposals is referred to as strategic environmental assessment. It seeks to incorporate environmental considerations into the development of public policies and strategic decisions.
                Strategic environmental assessment also serves to strengthen accountability and provide greater public confidence that federal government decisions are being made in full awareness of the potential environmental impact. Through strategic
                environmental assessment, environmental considerations can be addressed at the earliest appropriate stage of planning, along with economic and social considerations.</p>
              <p>A strategic environmental assessment must be a written or documented process that follows the elements included in this play. The Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency can provide additional assistance and support to departments and agencies
                in the development of their strategic environmental assessments, as well as further consultation of the Cabinet Directive itself.</p>
              <p>Note: This play highlights the three main components of the process. For a complete look at the five steps in the Impact&nbsp;Assessment Process, see the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/impact-assessment-agency/services/policy-guidance/impact-assessment-process-overview.html">Process Overview</a>                and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/impact-assessment-agency/services/policy-guidance/practitioners-guide-impact-assessment-act.html">Practitioner&rsquo;s Guide </a>from&nbsp;the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada.&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Guiding principles</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Early integration</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The consideration of environmental effects should begin early in the conceptual planning stages of the proposal.&nbsp;In this way, strategic environmental assessment can support the analysis
              of options and identify issues that may require further consideration.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Examination of alternatives</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The evaluation and comparison of alternatives will help identify how modifications or changes to the policy, plan or program can reduce environmental risk.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Flexibility</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Departments and agencies are encouraged to adapt and refine analytical methodologies and tools to address their&nbsp;particular circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Self-assessment</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Each department and agency&nbsp;is&nbsp;responsible for applying the assessment to its proposals, determining how the assessment should be conducted, carrying it out, and reporting on the findings.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Appropriate level of analysis</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The scope of the analysis should be commensurate with the level of anticipated environmental effects.</p>
            <p><strong>Accountability</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Accountability should be promoted through the involvement of affected individuals and organizations, when appropriate, and through documentation and reporting mechanisms.</p>
            <p><strong>Use of existing mechanisms</strong>&nbsp;- Departments and agencies should use existing mechanisms to conduct any analysis of environmental effects, involve the public if required, evaluate performance and report the results; existing
              reporting mechanisms should also be used to issue statements.&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Preliminary scan </h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>A preliminary scan screens for potential, important environmental effects, which can be either positive or negative. If important environmental effects are identified, a strategic environmental assessment is required.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In conducting the scan, you are responsible to:&nbsp;</p>
          <ol>
            <li>identify the direct and indirect outcomes associated with implementing the proposal; and</li>
            <li>consider whether these outcomes could affect any component of the environment or any of the Federal Sustainable Development Strategy&rsquo;s goals and targets.&nbsp;</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If the preliminary scan identifies the potential for important environmental effects, or if there is a high level of uncertainty or risk associated with the outcome, then an analysis of the environmental effects should be conducted through a
            strategic environmental assessment.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>If the scan does not identify the potential for important environmental effects, no further analysis of environmental effects is required.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>To conduct a scan of the proposal, you may use a variety of tools, including matrices, checklists and experts available within the department and from other departments. Transport Canada <a href="http://mytc/strategic-environmental-assessment-3717.html">has a comprehensive guide on strategic environmental assessments</a>            (accessible only on the Transport Canada network), including both a manual and assessment tool that help determine their necessity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p>The analysis of the environmental considerations should be iterative throughout the policy development process and be fully integrated into the analysis of each of the options developed, so that the consequences of alternative proposals can
            be compared. The final recommendation should be informed by the results of the strategic environmental assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The strategic environmental assessment should address the following considerations and questions:&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>scope and nature of potential effects&nbsp;</li>
            <li>the need for mitigation or opportunities for enhancement&nbsp;</li>
            <li>scope and nature of residual effects&nbsp;</li>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>Reporting is important to ensure that the process is open and accountable. For a policy, plan or program that is approved or announced, departments and agencies shall prepare a public statement of environmental effects, including impacts on
            the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/conservation/sustainability/federal-sustainable-development-strategy.html">Federal Sustainable Development Strategy</a>&rsquo;s&nbsp;goals and targets, when a strategic environmental
            assessment has been conducted. Departments and agencies are also encouraged to prepare a public statement of preliminary scans. For some proposals, departments and agencies may choose to release a public document that discusses the environmental
            effects in detail, in addition to any public statement of environmental effects.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Departments and agencies are responsible for reporting on the extent and results of their strategic environmental assessment practices in their <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/planned-government-spending/reports-plans-priorities.html">Departmental Plans</a>            and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/departmental-performance-reports.html">Departmental Results Reports</a>.&nbsp;This reporting should include a description in the Departmental Results
            Reports of how plans, programs and policies subject to strategic environmental assessment have affected or are expected to affect progress towards the Federal Sustainable Development Strategy&rsquo;s goals and targets. For more information
            on reporting requirements, departments and agencies should refer to Treasury Board guidance to departments on Departmental Plans and Departmental Results Reports.&nbsp;</p>
