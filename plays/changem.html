          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>Change Management is a comprehensive, cyclical, and structured approach to prepare,
          support, and help individuals, teams, and organizations transition from a current state to a future
          state with intended results and outcomes. Effective Change Management at Transport Canada
          is important.</p><br>
        <p>This Play is part of a series of Plays that will help guide you through the process of successfully
          integrating Change Management into each Phase of Transport Canada’s Project Management
          Framework (PMF).</p><br>

                <p>A Change Initiative is the act of altering something significant within an organization, requiring an
                  internal and external transition (consolidating organizations, moving to new offices, launching new
                  programs or services, updating software, or changing procedures).<br>

                  Running this Play will provide you with a preliminary understanding of how Change Management can
                  assist you in making your change initiative a success. Use this play as a starting point to deepen
                  your understanding of change within Transport Canada, how change works, the type of change you are
                  experiencing and models to consider to manage that change more effectively.<br>

                  It is recommended that you start off by bringing together the core project team responsible for
                  implementing the change and defining what the proposed change is.

            <p>To understand what is meant by <strong>Change Management</strong> it is helpful to first understand
              <strong>Transformation.</strong></p><br>
            <p>The terms “Transformation” and “Change” are sometimes used interchangeably, but are not necessarily the
              same.</p><br>
            <p><strong>Transformation</strong> is almost always large and significant. Transformation is an internal
              fundamental change in beliefs of why certain actions must be performed. Transformation does not require
              any external influence to maintain, and because of its fundamental nature, transformation is more likely
              permanent. Transformation is about <strong>modifying beliefs</strong> so that actions achieve the desired
              results.</p><br>
            <p><strong>Change,</strong> on the other hand, is typically smaller and more incremental in nature, but it
              can also be large and complex. We all face change every day. Change affects us all and we each deal with
              change differently. The only constant in life, the only thing we can be sure will happen is change, and
              change needs to be <u>constantly monitored, managed, and maintained.</u> When we think of Change
              Management processes and procedures, we typically think of IT initiatives. Every initiative is undertaken
              to make something better, faster, cheaper, leaner. Change has an owner, and metrics, and involves
              continual improvements. A conscious effort is needed to identify the need for change, identify change
              actions required to achieve the desired result, and maintain adoption of the solutions. Change is
              <strong>modifying actions</strong> to achieve desired results.</p><br>
            <p>Across Transport Canada, <strong>Transformation</strong> takes place at both the “Programme” and “Project” level. The Department’s Transformation Vision is to “change how we work to meet challenges, prepare for the future, and better serve the transportation system.” TC’s Transformation Plan was introduced in 2017 and has been driving critical changes within the department ever since. To learn more about TC Transformation, please visit <a href="https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/Transport_Canada%E2%80%99s_Transformation_Strategy">TC’s Transformation GCPedia page.</a></p><br>

          <p><strong>Change Management at Transport Canada</strong> takes place at both the “Enterprise/Organizational”
            level and the “Project” level.</p>
          <u>Enterprise/Organizational Change Management involves: </u>
          <ul>
            <li>Institutionalizing Change Management practices, processes, and competencies across and throughout an
              organization.</li>
            <li>Treating and managing “institutionalizing Change Management” (or Making it Stick) as a project and as
              the change. </li>
            <li>Ensuring effective Change Management on all projects/initiatives occurring in the organization.</li>
          </ul>
          <u>Change Management applied at the Project Level involves:</u>
          <ul>
            <li>A structured process and set of tools for leading the people side of change to a desired outcome or
              future state.</li>
            <li>Driving project success by supporting individual transitions required by projects and initiatives.</li>

          <h2 id="Understanding Change">Understanding Change
          </h2>
          <div>
            <p>One very helpful way of understanding the process of change for individuals, as well as groups, is the <a
                href="https://www.ekrfoundation.org/5-stages-of-grief/change-curve/">‘The Kübler-Ross Change Curve’,</a>
              also known as the transition curve. It is derived from the theory of how people cope with death and
              bereavement. All change involves the elements of letting go of the past, and engaging with a different
              future, as an individual or a group moves through the curve. There are many variations of this
              change/transition curve now in existence but the basic five-stage principal is pivotal in understanding
              how one may go through the process of change.
            </p><br>
            <p>The <u>Five Stages of Change</u> according to Elisabeth Kubler-Ross include:</p>
          </div><br>
          <p><strong>Change Management at Transport Canada</strong> takes place at both the “Enterprise/Organizational”
            level and the “Project” level.</p><br>
          <u>Enterprise/Organizational Change Management involves: </u>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Shock or Denial:</strong> "I can't believe it", "This can't be happening", "Not to me!", "Not
              again!"</li>
            <li><strong>Anger</strong> "Why me? It's not fair!" "NO! I can't accept this!"</li>
            <li><strong>Bargaining</strong>"Just let me live to see my children graduate."; "I'll do anything if you
              give me more time A few more years?"</li>
            <li><strong>Depression</strong>"I'm so sad, why bother with anything?"; "What's the point of trying?"</li>
            <li><strong>Acceptance</strong>"It's going to be OK."; "I can't fight it - I may as well prepare for it."
            </li>
          </ul><br>
          <p>Using the change curve diagram may lead you to believe that the process of change is linear. It is
            important to recognize that at each point on the change curve, a person can go forwards or backwards. [e.g.
            A person may reach a stage where they accept the change, but while getting coffee at work they hear news
            that throws them back into anger or denial.] Moving between the stages is expected. Therefore
            ongoing-continuous stakeholder engagement and communications is important. Keeping a finger on the pulse of
            change is critical to the success of Change Management.</p><br>

        <h5>Continuous Improvement</h5>
        <p>Continuous improvement is a method to make sure that government processes, methods, and practices are as
          efficient, effective, and economical as possible. This is done by periodically examining and improving
          organizational processes to fix bottlenecks, use the best software, and take advantage of the most efficient
          methods. Lean, kaizen and Six Sigma are similar examples of common forms of continuous improvement. The
          primary objective of any continuous improvement change is to reduce waste and streamline work. In certain
          circumstances, continuous improvement requires limited communications support and little if any Change
          Management assistance.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Developmental Change</h5>
        <p>Developmental change improves previously established processes and procedures and does not necessarily have
          to be of a large-scale nature. While not necessarily being an extensive change, developmental change is the
          most frequent type of organizational change. Government institutions experience these types of changes as
          incremental improvements in response to a desire to improve efficiencies, address a detected deficiency, or
          build upon prior success. Because developmental change is typically incremental and non-disruptive, it
          typically has a lower level of resistance within an organization. Over time, these smaller changes build and
          produce positive returns to the efficiency and effectiveness of the department or agency. Failing to respond
          to the need for improvement however may have the opposite effect and represent a loss of efficiency and
          effectiveness. In instances of developmental change, it is best if the initiative is supported by a small
          change and communications team.
        </p><br>
        <h5>Transitional Change</h5>
        <p>Frequently, departments and agencies know that they need to make a more significant change to remain
          effective and efficient. Transitional changes are larger than developmental changes. These changes may include
          amalgamating or de-amalgamating departments or replacing and introducing major new systems and processes. They
          frequently may impact relationships, job functions, culture, and involve substantial retraining. Because of
          the significance of these types of changes, management must proceed cautiously while not becoming stuck in a
          cycle of indecision that will lead to keeping the status-quo. A substantial Change Management investment is
          required in the case of transitional change, and that includes dedicated communications and engagement
          resources.
        </p><br>
        <h5>Transformational Change</h5>
        <p>Transformational change means adjustment in areas which are as a result of significant technological,
          economic, environmental, or political factors. Government organizations do not frequently undergo
          transformational change. These types of changes are dramatic and fundamentally alter the department or
          organization in question. This kind of change is brought about when an organization pursues entirely different
          programs and services, experiences radical changes in technology, or new leadership ushers in overhauls to the
          structure and organizational culture. The COVID-19 Pandemic would be an example of a Transformational Change.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Unlike the other types of change where the outcome is known or can be imagined with current understandings,
          the outcome for transformational change cannot usually be preconceived. It must be developed along the way.
          The change creates a need for new behaviours by the organization’s employees and external stakeholders. Being
          this change is the most pronounced, a substantial disruption to the organization will occur, and navigating it
          will require significant skills and expertise in a Change Management team, supported by a sizable
          communications team, to develop an overarching change and communication strategy, and coordinate all
          communication and stakeholder engagement activities.

        <h2 id="Common Change Management Models">Common Change Management Models</h2>
        <p>Managing change is difficult. It is hard to change the way you work and modify familiar processes to suit new
          needs and goals. Change can only be productive if the transition is successful. And to be successful, change
          communication needs to be properly integrated into the change initiative very early in the outset [likely
          earlier than most may think].</p><br>
        <p>There are many models for managing change. Some are linear, while others are more cyclical and iterative
          moving through (and back through) the different phases of change. Transport Canada has chosen to apply a
          combination of Kurt Lewin’s three stage model (illustrating how collective mindsets are broken down to enable
          change), and John Kotter’s more detailed road map for change (based on common errors made by organizations
          when they are trying to undertake major changes).<b>To see how Transport Canada has incorporated these models
          into its Change Management approach, please review our <a

          </a>
        </p>
        <h2>Kurt Lewin’s Simple Three Stage Model</h2>
        <h5>Unfreeze </h5>
        <p>This phase recognizes that collective mindsets and practices of a group must be broken down before a change
          can occur – and that subsequently effort is needed to consolidate the group’s new mindset and practices.</p>
        <br>
        <p>During the <strong>“Unfreeze” </strong>stage an organization must:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clearly define the current situation. The more collaborative this process can be, the more effective it
            will be. </li>
          <li>Create a vision of the desired end state. The more detailed this can be, the better.
          </li>
          <li>dentify what will help drive and may cause resistance to change. Your goal will be to activate drivers of
            change and mitigate the potential for increase in resistance. </li>
        </ul><br>
        <h5>Change</h5>
        <p>
          In this stage, a plan is followed to implement the intended change(s). Stakeholders at all levels of the
          change must be involved in problem solving solution finding. The ability to experiment with ideas in a safe,
          collaborative learning environment is key. At this stage, it is critical to provide great role models with
          whom stakeholders in change can identify with.
        </p><br>
        <h5>Refreeze</h5>

        <p>It is at the final stage of this model that new work practices become new work habits, and when new ways of
          thinking become the way forward. It is a time for vigilance on the part of change leaders, who must address
          any tendency for stakeholders to talk, think or act in line with the old ways. At this stage, it is important
          to reinforce and reward behaviours and results that are aligned with the changed environment.
        </p>

        <h2>John Kotter’s Eight-Stage Approach</h2>
        <p>John Kotter’s more detailed road map for change is a commonly accepted approach for strategic,
          organizational-level change. Each of the eight stages in Kotter’s model
          is to address the eight common errors
          that organizations make when trying to undertake major change. The whole process offers a roadmap for
          undertaking change with a strong focus on the role of effective leadership. With the right process and the
          right leadership, change can be planned and managed. The Eight-Stage approach focuses on:
        </p>
        <div>
          <ol type="1">
            <li><strong>Establishing a sense of urgency</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Creating the guiding coalition</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Developing a vision and a strategy</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Communicating the change vision</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Empowering employees for broad-based action</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Generating short-term wins</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Consolidating gains and producing more change</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Anchoring new approaches in the culture</strong></li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>Regardless of the model of the change process adopted, Communication and Stakeholder Engagement are always at
          the heart of any successful change initiative. An effect change communication and engagement strategy should
          describe the overall approach and <u>detailed work plans for engaging with and providing relevant, accurate,
            and
            consistent information to internal and external stakeholders affected by the change initiative.</u> </p><br>

            <div class="col-md-12">
              <div>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TIP: Communication and Stakeholder Engagement Strategy
                  </strong></p> <br>
                <p>In your Strategy, you should identify and define:</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>key messages</li>
              <li>stakeholders</li>
              <li>communication channels</li>
              <li>roles and responsibilities for communication</li>
            </ul>

          <p style="margin-left: 2px;">It is critical that you engage all stakeholders appropriate to potential impacts and provide them with the
            information they need to experience a successful transition. This approach also provides your team with an
            opportunity to assess stakeholder attitudes and sentiments to understand how best to engagement and activate
            them, or mitigate resistance from them. </p><br>
          <p style="margin-left: 2px;">Your strategy should also be supported by Communication Action Plan, which can provide tactical breakdowns
            of the communication and engagement activities to be performed throughout your three change stages:
            <strong>Unfreeze, Change, and Refreeze.</strong>
