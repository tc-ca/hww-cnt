              <p>What is design? Here, we try to give you a short and simple answer that sets the stage for the rest of this document.</p>
              <p>The scope of design involves three things (Figure 1):</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The Problem Space</li>
                <li>The Inbetween</li>
                <li>The Solution Space</li>
              </ul>
              <p><img id="imgFigure1" style="width: 100%;" src="../images/understandingdesign-figure-1-en.png" alt="Figure 1: The problem space, the solution space, and the inbetween.">
              <p class="figure-description">Figure 1: The problem space, the solution space, and the inbetween.</p>
              <hr>
              <p><strong>The Problem Space</strong> is where the design starts, with designers onboard. You aim to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Understand the presumed problem deeply and thoroughly</li>
                <li>Make assumptions about the problem (but NOT about the solution) for later validation</li>
                <li>Define the scope and the objectives of the effort for solving the problem</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>The In-between</strong> is where the focus of the design activities transition from the problem to the solution. You aim to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Generate ideas about potential solutions</li>
                <li>Define the potential approach to implement the solutions</li>
                <li>Verify those ideas and refine the approach</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>The Solution Space</strong> is where the design effort focuses on delivering solutions, with well-elaborated ideas and a well-refined approach to implement them. You aim to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Build the solution iteratively</li>
                <li>Test the solution frequently</li>
                <li>Refine the solution based on feedback and evidence</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In the above sense, design is a problem solving approach that enables you to frame your problem effectively, explore solutions creatively, build a solution efficiently, and achieve your goals satisfactorily.</p>

              <h3 id="subsection-spectrum">The Design Spectrum</h3>
              <p>Design consists of a spectrum of methodologies that range in scope, i.e. how zoomed in to the problem and solution space we want to be. We illustrate these in Figure 2.</p>
              <p>It’s important to understand that designing holistically involves all of these methodologies across the lifecycle of a product or service, and that no single methodology is more or less important than the others.</p>
              <hr>
              <p><img id="imgFigure1" style="width: 100%;" src="../images/understandingdesign-figure-2-en.png" alt="Figure 2: The four levels of design on a spectrum">
              <p class="figure-description">Figure 2: The four levels of design on a spectrum</p>
              <hr>
              <p>We briefly define each methodology here and then go into more details below:</p>
              <p><strong>Service Design (Level 4)</strong> concerns all products and services across the organization and all people involved, including end-users on the receiving end and employees on the delivery end. It focuses on the overall experience and on how products and services work together to define the organization’s mission and deliver on its vision.</p>
              <p><strong>Client/Customer Experience (CX) Design (Level 3)</strong> concerns the quality of a particular user group’s experience over their end-to-end journey with an organization and focuses on  delivering value to that group. In other words, it’s User Experience (UX) over a long period of time (see next).</p>
              <p><strong>User Experience (UX) Design (Level 2)</strong> concerns the quality of a person's experience when interacting with a specific part of a product or service to complete a specific task. It focuses on the utility, desirability, and experience with that task.</p>
              <p><strong>User Interface (UI) Design (Level 1)</strong> concerns the individual interactions that an end-user has with a particular component of a product or service. It focuses on making those single interactions simple, effective, and efficient.</p>
              <p>To help you understand the difference in scope of these methodologies, here is an example of how this might apply to various design challenges of a bank (Figure 3):</p>
              <hr>
              <p><img id="imgFigure1" style="width: 100%;" src="../images/understandingdesign-figure-3-en.png" alt="Figure 3: Four levels of design for a bank">
              <p class="figure-description">Figure 3: Four levels of design for a bank</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Those four levels of design have different focuses in many different ways. They’re specifically different in how each finds its balance regarding two dimensions (Figure 4):</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The strategic and the tactical side of solving problems</li>
                <li>The experiential and consequential aspect of the solution</li>
              </ul>
              <hr>

              <p class="figure-description">Figure 4: Characteristics of the four levels of design (Level 1: UI Design, Level 2: UX Design, Level 3: CX Design, Level 4: Service Design)</p>
              <hr>

              <h3 id="subsection-sd">Service Design</h3>
              <p>Service design is the broadest methodology in scope. It considers all of the people involved: both clients on the receiving end of a product or service, and employees on the delivery end. It also considers how various services interact with one another, and how the organization can create or innovate on services to deliver its mission and achieve its vision.</p>
              <blockquote>“Service design helps organizations see their services from a customer perspective. It is an approach to designing services that balances the needs of the customer with the needs of the business, aiming to create seamless and quality service experiences. Service design is rooted in design thinking, and brings a creative, human-centered process to service improvement and designing new services. Through collaborative methods that engage both customers and service delivery teams, service design helps organizations gain true, end-to-end understanding of their services, enabling holistic and meaningful improvements.”
              <br><cite>Source: This Is Service Design Doing: Applying Service Design Thinking in the Real World, by Marc Stickdorn, Markus Edgar Hormess, Adam Lawrence, Jakob Schneider</cite></blockquote>
              <p>The three main components of service design are: <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/service-design-101/" target="_blank" title="Service Design 101 (Nielsen Norman Group)">people, props, and processes</a>.</p>
              <p><strong>People</strong> are anyone who creates or uses a service, including anyone who may be indirectly involved (e.g. employees, partners, users).</p>
              <p><strong>Props</strong> are the artifacts or products that we use to perform the service, such as physical space, webpages, social media or digital files.</p>
              <p><strong>Processes</strong> are the workflows, procedures or other performed by the employee or user, such as resolving issues over support, or sharing a file.</p>
              <p>Service design is not simply about designing a service. It also addresses how an organization gets something done, fills in organizational gaps, and fulfills the purpose of the organization.</p>

              <h3 id="subsection-cx">Client/Customer Experience (CX) Design</h3>
              <p>Client or Customer Experience (CX) design is a step down in scope from Service Design. It considers the end-to-end journey of a particular client group across all of an organization’s products and services and considers this journey from the perspective of those clients.</p>
              <p>Often, CX cuts across business or product lines, since the client, over the lifetime of a client’s experience with an organization, will interact with many facets, channels, and touchpoints.</p>
              <p>The CX journey starts as easily as the client’s initial awareness of the organization and its products and services. It then considers how the organization can add value to the client through various products and services.</p>
              <p>Framed another way, CX is a subset of Service Design that only considers the products and services targeted to a particular client group.</p>
              <p>Another way of looking at CX is that it comprises many UX touchpoints (<a href="#subsection-ux">see below</a>).</p>

              <h3 id="subsection-ux">User Experience (UX) Design</h3>
              <p>User Experience (UX) Design is a methodology that focuses on the experience of a particular client group with a particular product or service, or even a component of a particular product or service.</p>
              <p>It’s a methodology that creates tangible things that a user will interact with directly. It focuses on things like creating useful solutions that are easy to use. It’s about enhancing the experience that people have while interacting with a product, and making sure they find value in what the product provides.</p>
              <p>Questions about “why” we might need a particular product or touchpoint are addressed at a higher level of design (often <a href="#subsection-cx">CX Design</a>)  as well as questions about how they fit into the organization (often <a href="#subsection-sd">Service Design</a>).</p>
              <p>It’s a misconception that UX is only about “digital.” UX is about any touchpoint where a user interacts with a product or service. For example, the interaction between a user and a call centre is subject to UX design.</p>

              <h3 id="subsection-ui">User Interface (UI) Design</h3>
              <p>User Interface (UI) Design focuses on a single element of a touchpoint. For example, the word we use on the button on a webpage to pay for items in the cart, the colour of that button, or the placement of that button on the page.</p>
              <p>UI Design is all about understanding and anticipating specific tasks that a user is trying to accomplish with the touchpoint, and ensuring that the touchpoint has elements that are easy to access, understand, and use, and to facilitate those tasks in an easy and efficient way.</p>

              <h3 id="subsection-role-uxu">UX Unicorn</h3>
              <p>Unfortunately, UX Unicorn does not exist.</p>
              <p>This concept has misled people to believe that one person can fulfill all of their design needs. That is hopelessly far from the truth.</p>
              <p>Chances are, it’s extremely unlikely for you to find one person who can do every job within the scope of design, yet another reason why it is so important to really identify and specify your needs properly.</p>
              <p>There are indeed designers with combinatory skill sets who can do several different things in design, and you may need them more often than you think. But also know that, nowadays, design work is almost always collaborative.</p>
              <blockquote>“...most artists, if they're honest, are never solo artists...” — Thom Yorke</blockquote>
              <p>A UX Unicorn can assist you in the following design levels:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>(None) If anyone told you otherwise, beware of snake oil.</li>
