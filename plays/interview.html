          <h2>Preparation</h2>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8">
              <p><strong>Decide on broad vs deep</strong></p>
              <p>Do you want to explore general usage patterns, and give&nbsp;users a chance to give broad feedback? If so, plan for an open-ended interview and just go with the flow. Or, are you looking for something specific? You can use the interview
                to validate assumptions you have about a feature (like the ones on your project poster). You might also talk to&nbsp;users that have reported problems and go deep in that area.</p>
              <p><strong>Form an interview team</strong></p>
              <p>Anyone can participate in a&nbsp;user&nbsp;interview, but typically a product owner, service lead, or someone on the front lines (e.g., developer, designer, service operator,&nbsp;etc) fills the role of interviewer. You&rsquo;ll also want
                another person from your team along to play the role of scribe and generally be your co-pilot. Don&rsquo;t try and be both the interviewer and scribe &ndash; you&rsquo;ll get distracted and won&rsquo;t be actively listening.</p>
              <p>Including a silent observer is a great way to make sure you don&rsquo;t overlook any gold coins. Their job is to absorb the conversation and listen for themes or connections the interviewer and scribe are too busy to catch.</p>
              <p><strong>Find the right&nbsp;</strong><strong>user</strong><strong>s to interview</strong>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Consider your goals for the interview and make sure you&rsquo;re recruiting participants who&rsquo;ll contribute to them.</p>
              <p>For each prospective participant, get to know them as well as possible before reaching out, and write up a few details for reference: what product/s or service they use, team size, what feedback they&rsquo;ve already provided, and any information
                about their role that might be relevant.</p>
              <p>When you&rsquo;ve identified interview participants, recruit them with an engaging invite that explains your goals for the interview, how long it&rsquo;ll take, and when you&rsquo;re hoping to conduct it. If the participant is in your local
                area, offer to hold the interview at their office &ndash; it&rsquo;s easiest for them, and you&rsquo;ll benefit from the richer context of being in your participant&rsquo;s natural habitat. Or invite them to visit your office if you can&rsquo;t
                come to them for whatever reason. If an in-person session isn&rsquo;t possible, a video or phone call can work.</p>
              <p><strong>Identify relevant policies or guidelines</strong></p>
              <p>Interviews for behavioural research, user research, and consultations are generally not considered to&nbsp;be public opinion research, but you may want to determine if your interviews could be considered&nbsp;as such.&nbsp;See&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/public-opinion-research-government.html">Defining Public Opinion Research</a>&nbsp;for
                more information.&nbsp;With&nbsp;public opinion research, there are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=30682#appC">specific requirements</a>&nbsp;that would need to be followed.</p>
              <p>In addition, you may wish to familiarize yourself with some of the following sources for interviews involving regulations, Indigenous groups, or public engagement:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/federal-regulatory-management/guidelines-tools/effective-regulatory-consultations.html">Guidelines for Effective Regulatory Consultations</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1331832510888/1331832636303">Government of Canada and the duty to consult</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://open.canada.ca/en/content/principles-and-guidelines">Public Engagement Principles</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Craft an interview script</strong></p>
              <p>Brainstorm at least 20 possible questions. Then trim it down to 10 or fewer (assuming you have an hour with the interview participant). Start by cutting any questions you can easily answer with a&nbsp;&ldquo;yes&rdquo;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&ldquo;no&rdquo;.
                Open ended questions tend to work best.</p>
              <p>Be wary of confirmation bias &ndash; i.e., are you leading the witness? Make sure your questions are designed to let the participant&rsquo;s views come through nice and strong. And include some soft-ball questions to kick off the interview
                and establish a rapport: how long they&rsquo;ve been in their role, etc.</p>
              <p><strong>Plan your analysis and reporting methods</strong></p>
              <p>You will want to determine your methods for analyzing the data that you collect from your&nbsp;user&nbsp;interviews as well as how you will report back on your findings. There are&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;courses and readings listed at the
                end of this Play that can assist you in learning about the various approaches to interview data collection and analysis.</p>
              <p>For sharing your findings, you may wish to share a summary report directly back with your&nbsp;users, publish your findings on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/consultations/consultingcanadians.html">Consulting With Canadians</a>&nbsp;website,&nbsp;
                <a href="http://www.gazette.gc.ca/">Canada Gazette</a>, or another platform.</p>
              <p>In addition, make sure that you have considered privacy requirements and safeguards when collecting, analyzing and sharing the findings.&nbsp;You may want to include this information in your interview script for easy reference.</p>
              <p><strong>Get ready for game day</strong>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>You&rsquo;re finally going to conduct the interviews! You&rsquo;ve printed copies of the interview script and any other printed materials that might be required. Your recording device is charged. The interview room (if at your office) is
                tidy and has a relaxed vibe.</p>
              <p>Make sure your interview team understands their roles so you can operate like a well-oiled machine. Scribes should avoid leading the interview, and observers should ask questions only at the very end.</p>

                <p>Now for the actual interviews! Think of these steps as suggestions, and feel free to tweak them to suit your needs and your style.</p>
                <p><strong>Housekeeping</strong></p>
                <p>Welcome the participant and thank them for coming (sounds obvious, but it&rsquo;s easy to forget!).&nbsp;Discuss the goals, reasons for the interview, and what you will do with the input that they provide.&nbsp;Identify whether their feedback
                  will be kept confidential and explain any safeguards that you will be undertaking.</p>
                <p>(Optional) Ask if it&rsquo;s ok to record the interview so you&rsquo;ve got everything verbatim in case the scribe falls behind a bit.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Warm-up questions</strong></p>
                <p>Lead with the soft-ball questions from the interview script you prepared. Part of the foundation you&rsquo;re laying here is establishing rapport. Pay attention to cues like body language and tone. Does the interviewee feel at ease? Are
                  they giving you the full story?&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Meaty questions</strong></p>
                <p>Now dive into the questions from your interview script to get the specifics you&rsquo;re after. Feel free to ask follow-up questions if you uncover a pearl of wisdom that you wish to explore.</p>
                <p>Really, feel free to spend the bulk of your time here having a loose conversation with the participant about what you&rsquo;re trying to learn from them. The prepared questions will serve as an outline and are there for your reference
                  if you get stuck.</p>
                <p>Make sure you&rsquo;re validating your notes as the interview goes along. Try occasionally repeating back or clarifying important points to ensure that you have captured them accurately.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Observer questions</strong></p>
                <p>If you have observers in the room, and they have additional questions, now is the time.</p>
                <p>The questions should prompt deeper thought and reflection. &ldquo;Is this an important feature?&rdquo; is a bad question. &ldquo;Why is this feature useful?&rdquo; is a good question. &ldquo;What would happen if this feature disappeared?&rdquo;
                  is even better &ndash; it&rsquo;ll either sharply illustrate the feature&rsquo;s value, or make the&nbsp;user&nbsp;realize that their life wouldn&rsquo;t change much and maybe the feature isn&rsquo;t so critical after all.</p>
                <p><strong>Turn the tables</strong></p>
                <p>We get more out of interviews when we turn them into a two-way conversation. Before the session winds down, give your participant a chance to ask questions of you.</p>
                <p><strong>Wrap it up</strong></p>
                <p>Thank the participant for their time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
