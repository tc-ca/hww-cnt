                <p>The success of Canada’s transportation sector is very much dependent on TC services such as inspections and authorizations (including licences and certificates) for individuals and companies, enabling Canadian transportation industries
                  to operate safely and efficiently. </p>
                <p>Modernizing TC’s service fees and fee structures is critical in order to respond to the evolving transportation landscape. The Department’s cost recovery framework must consider the growing operating costs in an increasingly complex, technologically-advanced
                  and internationally-integrated transportation sector in order to provide efficient and predictable services across all sectors.</p>

              <ul>
                <li class="checkbox">Administrative burden for service recipients should be reduced, where possible.</li>

              <ul>
                <li class="checkbox">Fees should have a direct relationship to the cost of providing the service.</li>
                <li class="checkbox">Fees should be implemented commensurate with what the market can bear, taking into account diverse industry sectors and service recipients financial capacity to pay. </li>
                <li class="checkbox">A whole-of-government approach should be applied when assessing impact to the economic sector. </li>
                <li class="checkbox">The recipients who benefit directly from TC services, rather than the general public, should bear the majority of the costs. </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Consistency</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li class="checkbox">New or amended fees, contracts, and revenue agreements should be applied consistently across services and sectors where feasible and to the maximum extent possible. </li>
                <li class="checkbox">Fees between and within modes should be applied as consistently as possible with regards to similar or the same services. </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Sustainability</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li class="checkbox">TC’s capacity and ability to deliver its mandate in a timely manner should be enhanced. </li>
                <li class="checkbox">Fees should be easily adaptable to changes in the operating environment, and easy to update. </li>
                <li class="checkbox">Consideration should be given to the materiality of the fee; in terms of the benefit derived versus the cost of administering the fee. </li>

          <h2>Cost Recoverable Activities</h2>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8">
              <p>The primary criteria used by TC to assess eligibility for cost recovery is the degree to which an activity provides direct benefits to specific private individuals or entities beyond those benefits enjoyed by the general public. </p>
              <h4>Direct Benefits </h4>
              <p>Direct benefits are exhibited in many forms. An individual licence holder directly benefits from holding a licence as it provides the individual with regulated access to commercial markets, labour markets, and/or leisure opportunities. Private
                entities realize direct benefits via TC regulatory activities in the form of: reduced risks and liabilities; improved market access for their products and services; enhanced credibility; and enhanced public confidence in their industries.
              </p>
              <h4>Statutory Basis for Cost Recovery Activities </h4>
              <p>Cost recoverable activities are typically (although not always) activities that have a statutory basis – in other words, activities related to services, programs, etc., that are set out in legislation or regulations. Ideally, in addition
                to the cost recoverable activity being established by statute or regulation, the authority to cost recover for those activities should also be explicitly referenced in law – put another way, the enabling statute should provide the Governor
                in Council or the Minister the authority to make regulations setting fees for particular activities. </p>
              <h4>When a Statutory Basis for Cost Recovery Activities Does Not Exist</h4>
              <p>The introduction of a cost recovery regime for statutory activities that lack the authority to recover costs first requires Cabinet approval, generally though a Memorandum to Cabinet. Such approval would entail authorization to either establish
                a cost recovery regime under the FAA or under the specific legislation governing the program or activity. Where a legislative amendment is required, business lines should consult with the Parliamentary Affairs and Departmental Regulatory
                Affairs and follow the process outlined in the Privy Council Office’s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/privy-council/services/publications/guide-making-federal-acts-regulations.html" target="_blank">Guide to Making Federal Acts and Regulations</a>.
              </p>
              <p>The Minister also has the capacity to enter into a contract for the provision of activities or services that currently do not have a statutory basis (i.e. non-statutory contract). Consultation with the Corporate Cost Recovery Team and Departmental
                Legal Services should be undertaken when considering this type of cost recovery arrangement. </p>

                <h4>Tip</h4>
                <p>Generally, a cost recoverable activity falls into one of the following categories:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The provision of a service;</li>
                  <li>The provision of the use of a facility; </li>
                  <li>The conferral, by means of a licence, permit or other authorization, of a right or privilege; </li>
                  <li>The provision of a product; or </li>
                  <li>Non-statutory contract.</li>

                <p>TC will strive to implement consistent fee design for similar activities in different modes. Fee design begins with the determination of the appropriate fee type for the activity being delivered.</p>
                <p>The following are fee types that are applicable to services provided by TC:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Flat Fee</li>
                  <li>Hourly Fee</li>

                <p>A service standard is a commitment to a level of performance that tells service recipients what to expect in terms of speed of service delivery, how services will be delivered and what they can do when they are not satisfied with the standard
                  of service they receive. Service standards are integral to good client service and to effectively managing performance.

            <div class="col-md-8">

              <p>Fee proposals are developed and used during engagement with stakeholders. They are used to discuss the introduction of new fees or the modification of existing fees, prior to formal consultation as part of the regulatory process. By doing
                extensive engagement, the regulatory process is&nbsp;accelerated&nbsp;and comments received by the stakeholders during that process are limited.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;Each Fee Proposal must include the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Description of the service for which the fee is proposed and the circumstances in which the fee will be payable;</li>
                <li>Policy rationale for the fee;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Costing analysis;</li>
                <li>Amount of the fee or the manner for determining its amount;</li>
                <li>Factors&nbsp;taken into account&nbsp;in determining the amount of the fee or the manner for determining its amount, including:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Results of the public versus private benefit assessment;</li>
                    <li>Results of the international benchmarking analysis;</li>
                    <li>Results of the impact assessment or Economic Impact Assessment (where applicable);</li>

                <p>Consultation with the Corporate Cost Recovery Team is required before proceeding with a Fee Proposal. The TC Fee Proposal Template is the basis of all fee proposals for the Department. You will find the template at <a href="http://mytc/RDIMS/13460165"

              <div>
                <p>Best practice is to engage as early as possible in the decision-making process and throughout. Engagement can be undertaken in a number of different formats, depending on the level and interest of stakeholders and other strategic considerations
                  associated with individual business lines. The duration, scope and intensity of engagement may vary by business line, depending on the nature of the fee, the type of impacted stakeholder, and other considerations such as linkages to
                  other initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
