                                <p>Modernizing TC’s service fees and fee structures is critical in order to respond to the evolving transportation landscape.

                    <h2>Cost Recoverable Activities</h2>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-8">
                            <p>The primary criteria used by TC to assess eligibility for cost recovery is the degree to which an activity provides direct benefits to specific private individuals or entities beyond those benefits enjoyed by the general public. </p>
                            <h4>Direct Benefits </h4>
                            <p>Direct benefits are exhibited in many forms. An individual licence holder directly benefits from holding a licence as it provides the individual with regulated access to commercial markets, labour markets, and/or leisure opportunities. Private entities realize direct benefits via TC regulatory activities in the form of: reduced risks and liabilities; improved market access for their products and services; enhanced credibility; and enhanced public confidence in their industries. </p>
                            <h4>Statutory Basis for Cost Recovery Activities </h4>
                            <p>Cost recoverable activities are typically (although not always) activities that have a statutory basis – in other words, activities related to services, programs, etc., that are set out in legislation or regulations. Ideally, in addition to the cost recoverable activity being established by statute or regulation, the authority to cost recover for those activities should also be explicitly referenced in law – put another way, the enabling statute should provide the Governor in Council or the Minister the authority to make regulations setting fees for particular activities. </p>
                            <h4>When a Statutory Basis for Cost Recovery Activities Does Not Exist</h4>
                            <p>The introduction of a cost recovery regime for statutory activities that lack the authority to recover costs first requires Cabinet approval, generally though a Memorandum to Cabinet. Such approval would entail authorization to either establish a cost recovery regime under the FAA or under the specific legislation governing the program or activity. Where a legislative amendment is required, business lines should consult with the Parliamentary Affairs and Departmental Regulatory Affairs and follow the process outlined in the Privy Council Office’s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/privy-council/services/publications/guide-making-federal-acts-regulations.html" target="_blank">Guide to Making Federal Acts and Regulations</a>. </p>
                            <p>The Minister also has the capacity to enter into a contract for the provision of activities or services that currently do not have a statutory basis (i.e. non-statutory contract). Consultation with the Corporate Cost Recovery Team and Departmental Legal Services should be undertaken when considering this type of cost recovery arrangement. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-4 ">

                                <p>Generally, a cost recoverable activity falls into one of the following categories:</p>
                               <ul>
                                  <li>The provision of a service;</li>
                                  <li>The provision of the use of a facility; </li>
                                  <li>The conferral, by means of a licence, permit or other authorization, of a right or privilege; </li>
                                  <li>The provision of a product; or </li>
                                  <li>Non-statutory contract.</li>

<p>TC will strive to implement consistent fee design for similar activities in different modes. Fee design begins with the determination of the appropriate fee type for the activity being delivered.</p>
<p>The following are fee types that are applicable to services provided by TC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flat Fee</li>
<li>Hourly Fee</li>
<li>Hourly with Fee Cap</li>
<li>Hybrid (Flat Fee and Hourly)</li>
<li>Per Unit of Measure</li>
<li>Differentiated Pricing</li>
</ul>
<p>Consult the <a href="http://mytc/RDIMS/13236788" target="_blank">Transport Canada Cost Recovery Implementation Framework</a>&nbsp; (accessible only on the Transport Canada network) for details on fee types.</p>

Service standards are integral to good client service and to effectively managing performance.

<p>Fee proposals are developed and used during engagement with stakeholders.

By doing extensive engagement, the regulatory process is&nbsp;accelerated&nbsp;and comments received by the stakeholders during that process are limited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Each Fee Proposal must include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Description of the service for which the fee is proposed and the circumstances in which the fee will be payable;</li>
<li>Policy rationale for the fee;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Costing analysis;</li>
<li>Amount of the fee or the manner for determining its amount;</li>
<li>Factors&nbsp;taken into account&nbsp;in determining the amount of the fee or the manner for determining its amount, including:
<ul>
<li>Results of the public versus private benefit assessment;</li>
<li>Results of the international benchmarking analysis;</li>
<li>Results of the impact assessment or Economic Impact Assessment (where applicable);</li>
<li>Additional policy considerations; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>Stakeholder consultation.</li>
